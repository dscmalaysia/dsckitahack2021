# index.html merging process

**_MERGING PROCESS BEGAN 03/03_**

## Key notes

1.  All CSS files merged into one single CSS file `main.css` duplicates are not yet removed, we need to meet and talk about them
2.  The `index.html` file is not fully merged, some parts are still missing and some are not made responsive yet. Need the help of the team to make them so.
3.  Imported the pictures from Figma as SVGs.
4.  Added relevant comments to make the code easier to read and review

## What's next

1.  Review the code for feedback and comments.
2.  Bug fixing: Responsiveness mainly and some other key features to fix.
3.  Work on the missing stuff (mainly me taki the writer of this as of now FAQ + SCHEDULE)

**NOTE: I kept a backup file this time (even during the writing of this I messed up several times and lost changes because of branch changing XD don't blast me on dis pls it hurts to write code literally thrice :'( but I do have a backup file with all of the changes so no worries)**

**Feedback is most welcome ping me on discord**
