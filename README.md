# index.html UPDATE

## Key notes

1.  Added the FAQ section. It is dynamic and responsive.

### How does it work?

```js
let FAQs = [
  ["Question1", "answer1"],
  ["Question2", "answer2"],
];
```

It's a 2D array like such. Any new FAQs append it to the array and it will automatically be rendered. The array is sat in `js/FAQ.js`

## What's next

1.  Review the code for feedback and comments.
2.  Bug fixing: Responsiveness mainly and some other key features to fix.
3.  Work on the missing stuff (mainly me taki the writer of this as of now FAQ + SCHEDULE)

**NOTE: I kept a backup file this time (even during the writing of this I messed up several times and lost changes because of branch changing XD don't blast me on dis pls it hurts to write code literally thrice :'( but I do have a backup file with all of the changes so no worries)**

**Feedback is most welcome ping me on discord**
